This is one of my iphone projects. 

The app is using ASIHTTPRequest to send a JSON request to server. Once getting the JSON data back, using a JSON parser to convert the data to computable format in objective-c. 

For the server, I use google host server to store my test.json file.

Some summary of using iphone GEOLocation library:
1, it is interesting concept of using delegate in iphone app.
2, The delegate is the object itself and autoload the delegate method that you have to overwrite in order to ask the iphone to locate a place.

Here is the link to the json data: https://test-data-app.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/test.json

Thanks for Rayn Detert's help.
